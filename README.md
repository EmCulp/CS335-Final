#CS335 Final Project
  This project is for my Cybersecurity Class Final, where we got to choose which topic we wanted to dive into further detail on. I picked QR Codes since you see them everywhere these days. So, in this simple project, all that was needed was a webpage, a QR generator, and WireShark. You can create you're own webpage, or use one from the web. I made my own simple webpage since I wanted to have fun with it. So I added that webpage to GitHub pages so that it would be a live webpage. Then I ran it through the QR generator and tested to make sure it works and that the YouTube video that I have on there was running correctly. I also tested it on WireShark to see what goes down behind the scence when someone scans a QR code. As expected, you can see the packets acknowledging, resetting and whatnot in order to see that the scan went through and redirected the "victim" to the webpage.
